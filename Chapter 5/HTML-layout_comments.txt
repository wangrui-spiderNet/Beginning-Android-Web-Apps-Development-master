  HEADER 
  We are adding two different sub headings (h6) to this page. 
  One heading will be for the "Smartphone Edition" of the
  page and the second will be for the "Tablet Edition" 
  of the page. Both pages are the same but depending on 
  the screen size the pages CSS will tell the browser which
  subheading to display.

  	SECTION: FEATURED ARTICLES 
  	The featured article would be the main article on the page
    that will be featured. Think of it in this sense as the 
    front page story on a newspaper - which makes sense since
    this demos completed code would be a mock vintage newspaper
    layout.
    
    The article contains several sections. You have the header 
    section which contains the title of the article as well as 
    a "figure" or image that would be displayed with the article
    and any caption text that would go along with it.

  	SECTION: REGULAR ARTICLES 
  	The regular articles on this page will be housed in this 
    section of the document. The markup of this section is
    exactly the same as the featured articles section. The only
    difference will come down to how they are displayed based 
    off their assigned styles.
